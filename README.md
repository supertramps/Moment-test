**In A Moment**

_Happy deathd- I.. ehrm.. mean birthday._

This tool is created to give you a birds eye view on your lifetime. Where are you right now? Where will you be in just a moment?

You don't have to do anything fancy to run this calculator. Clone this repo and open the folder in your favourite IDE.

This was created during a school assignment where we were told to try out different frameworks. I chosed Moment.js and this is the result. Enjoy.
